    - Regression is a form ML technique which help investigate the relationship between a dependent and independent variable.
    - mainly used for forecasting, time series modeling and finding the causal relationship between variables.

    - There are mainly following **types of regression**:
     * [Linear regression](https://github.com/Rxtreem65/Machine_Learning_Notes/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Supervised%20Learning/Regression/Linear%20regression)
     * Multiple linear regression
     * Logistic regression
     * polynomial regression
     * Lasso regression 
     * Ridge regression
     * Stepwise regression
     * ElasticNet Regression
 
 
- Some example of regression are:
     - relationship between rash driving and number of accidents
     - relationship between years of experiance and salary
 
### How does regression help in data analysis?
    - indicating relationship between dependent and independent variable
    - the strength of impact of independent variable on the dependent variable
    - help predicting making models for analysis
