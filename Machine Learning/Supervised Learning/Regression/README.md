# Regression
- It is a supervised learning technique
- Regression is a form ML technique which help investigate the relationship between a dependent and independent variable.
- mainly used for forecasting, time series modeling and finding the causal relationship between variables.

- There are mainly following **types of regression**:
     * [Linear regression](https://github.com/Rxtreem65/Machine_Learning_Notes/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Supervised%20Learning/Regression/into_to_linear_regression.ipynb)
     * Multiple linear regression
     * Logistic regression
     * [Polynomial regression](https://github.com/Rxtreem65/Machine_Learning_Notes/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Supervised%20Learning/Regression/polynomial_regression.ipynb)
     * Lasso regression 
     * Ridge regression
     * Stepwise regression
     * ElasticNet Regression
 
 
- Some example of regression are:
     - relationship between rash driving and number of accidents
     - relationship between years of experiance and salary
 
### How does regression help in data analysis?
- indicating relationship between dependent and independent variable
- the strength of impact of independent variable on the dependent variable
- help predicting making models for analysis

### Linear Regression
- The regression it one-to-one relation between dependent and the independent variable.
- it helps model a linear relationship between independent and dependent variable.
- it very sensitive to outliers. 

Equation for Regression is
$ y = m_1*x_1 + m_2*x_2 + ... + m_n*x_3 + b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n $

where **y** = dependent variable, **m** = co-efficient of the idependent variable, **x** = independent variable, **b** = the bias for each variable
