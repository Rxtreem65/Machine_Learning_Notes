# Linear Regression
- The regression it one-to-one relation between dependent and the independent variable.
- it helps model a linear relationship between independent and dependent variable.
- it very sensitive to outliers. 

Equation for Regression is
$$ y = m_1*x_1 + m_2*x_2 + ... + m_n*x_3 + b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n$$

where **y** = dependent variable, **m** = co-efficient of the idependent variable, **x** = independent variable, **b** = the bias for each variable
