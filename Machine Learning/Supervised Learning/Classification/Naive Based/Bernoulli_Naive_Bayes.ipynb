    "# Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "- It is sub-type of Naive Bayes theorem which works on Bernouli's theorem\n",
    "- It is generaly used for discrete data, with features in binay form\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bernoulli distribution\n",
    "As we deal with binary values let, **z** be the probability of sucess thus **1-z** be the probability of failure. Then for the random variable **X** the bernouli classifier is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(x) = P[X=x] = \\begin{cases}1-z & x = 0\\\\\n",
    "z & x = 1\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** therom beomes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{x_i}{y}\\end{pmatrix} = P\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{i}{y}\\end{pmatrix}x_i + \\begin{pmatrix}1 - P\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{i}{y}\\end{pmatrix}\\end{pmatrix}(1-x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Bernoulli Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are extremely fast as compared to other classification models and can also be used for realtime prediction\n",
    "- It can handle irrelevant features nicely and work with relevent features because of explicit penalty to the model for non-occurrence of any of the features which are necessary for predicting the output y. \n",
    "- In case of small amount of data or small documents(for example in text classification), Bernoulli Naive Bayes gives more accurate and precise results as compared to other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disdvantages of Bernoulli Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since, it only works in haves and have nots, it sometimes makes a strong assumption based on the shape of data\n",
    "- Just like all Naive Bayes, the dependent features can affect the prediction and accuracy of the model. \n",
    "- If there is a categorial variable which is not present in training dataset, it results in zero frequency problem. This problem can be easily solved by Laplace estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is no fun learnings the theory, let us implement of a burnoulli naive bayes model \n",
