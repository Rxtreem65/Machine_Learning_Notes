    "# Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "- It is sub-type of Naive Bayes theorem which works on Bernouli's theorem\n",
    "- It is generaly used for discrete data, with features in binay form\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Bernoulli Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are extremely fast as compared to other classification models and can also be used for realtime prediction\n",
    "- It can handle irrelevant features nicely and work with relevent features because of explicit penalty to the model for non-occurrence of any of the features which are necessary for predicting the output y. \n",
    "- In case of small amount of data or small documents(for example in text classification), Bernoulli Naive Bayes gives more accurate and precise results as compared to other models.\n",

    "### Disdvantages of Bernoulli Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since, it only works in haves and have nots, it sometimes makes a strong assumption based on the shape of data\n",
    "- Just like all Naive Bayes, the dependent features can affect the prediction and accuracy of the model. \n",
    "- If there is a categorial variable which is not present in training dataset, it results in zero frequency problem. This problem can be easily solved by Laplace estimation."
