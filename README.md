# Machine_Learning_Notes
This repo contains my compilation of codes, resources and hands on tutorials for learning artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). If I could have found this resource, my ML journey would have been remarkable. Anyways, I don't want others to face the same problem as me. Thus, I am creating this repo. Hope this helps in your ML and AL learning journey. Also, this repo is work in progress so please be patient with me and keep learning. Thank you.
